# Activity for Futures

## Instructions

In package controllers, implement both methods.
The first method should be completed using `map` and `flatMap` only
The second method should be completed using a `for` - `yield` comprehension
Both methods should output the same result.
The expected result is: `"Luke Skywalker - Jedi - 0"`
The methods to use to get this data are in the connector wrapped in futures. These methods represent calls to an API for data.

## Running
To run this, just use `sbt test`
